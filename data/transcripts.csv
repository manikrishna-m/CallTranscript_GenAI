Member: Sure, I'll hold.

Agent: Thank you for holding, Emily. I've checked your eligibility and it looks like you have a deductible of $500 that needs to be met before we can pre-authorize the procedure.

Member: Okay, I was aware of that. But I was told by my doctor's office that the procedure would be covered.

Agent: I understand, Emily. However, our system is showing that the deductible needs to be met first. I can provide you with a quote for the estimated cost of the procedure, but I won't be able to pre-authorize it until the deductible is met.

Member: That's frustrating. Can you tell me how much the deductible is and how much the procedure will cost?

Agent: Based on our estimates, the procedure will cost around $2,000. Your deductible is $500, so you would need to pay that amount out of pocket before we can cover the remaining $1,500.

Member: Okay, I see. Well, can I get a pre-authorization for the amount that you will cover?

Agent: I apologize, Emily, but our system won't allow me to pre-authorize only a portion of the procedure. It's all or nothing. If you'd like, I can provide you with a letter explaining the situation and you can discuss it further with your doctor's office.

Member: Okay, that sounds good. Can you send me the letter via email?

Agent: Yes, I can do that. But, Emily, please note that this case is not pre-authorized and you may be responsible for the full amount of the procedure.

Customer Support: Hi Emily, sorry to hear that your claim was denied. Can you please tell me more about the claim and why you think it was denied incorrectly?

Member: Yes, of course. I had a medical procedure done and I submitted a claim for it, but it was denied because the policy doesn't cover that service. However, I had switched to a new policy a few months ago and I'm pretty sure that this new policy does cover that service.

Customer Support: I understand. Can you please confirm your new policy details with me so I can look into this further?

Member: Yes, my new policy is effective from January 1st of this year.

Customer Support: Okay, thank you for confirming that. I'm going to check on this real quick. (pause) Ah, I think I see the issue. It looks like your new policy hasn't been updated in our system, which is why the claim was denied.

Member: That makes sense, I guess. So what can be done to resolve this?

Customer Support: I'm going to go ahead and connect you with our Claims Review team. They'll be able to review your claim again and make the necessary adjustments to get it approved.

Customer Support: I understand. Let me check on that for you. (pause) Okay, I've checked on the policy information, and it looks like your new policy has not been updated in our system. That's why the claim was denied.

Customer Support: I apologize again for the mistake, Emily. I'm going to document everything that happened so that we can prevent this from happening in the future.

Member: I need to see a cardiologist, and I was thinking maybe next Wednesday or Thursday?

Customer Support: Okay, let me check the availability of our cardiologists. (pause) I have Dr. Smith available on Wednesday at 2 PM or Thursday at 10 AM. Would either of those work for you?

Member: Yeah, either one is fine. But I was really hoping to get in sooner. Can't you check if there are any earlier appointments available?

Customer Support: I apologize, but those are the earliest available appointments with Dr. Smith. However, I can offer you an appointment with Dr. Johnson on Monday at 3 PM.

Member: But I specifically asked for Dr. Smith. Why can't I get an appointment with him sooner?

Customer Support: I understand your preference, Ms. Wilson, but Dr. Smith is a very busy specialist, and his schedule is fully booked. I can offer you the appointment with Dr. Johnson, or I can put you on a waitlist for Dr. Smith, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's unlikely that an earlier appointment will become available.
